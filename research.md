## Ethnic Representation
* What can leaders do to reduce ethnic tensions and foster ethnic tolerance?
* How do diverse elites interact with one another? Does a diverse elite provoke intra-elite intolerance? Can interethnic contact between elites moderate this effect? Does interethnic contact make elites more sympathetic to minority targeted policies?
* Do citizens respond to ethnic representation in the executive by increasing approval for the government? Do other factors like partisan alignment or political position impact perceptions about ethnic representation? Is there a backlash to ethnic representation among majority citizens?
* Are citizens willing to engage in collective action to promote representation of their ethnic group? Do citizen preferences for descriptive and/or substantive representation condition collective action willingness?
* How can ethnic representation be conceptualized? What counts as a salient ethnic group? How can ethnic diversity in the executive be measured?


## Biases in Media Reporting
* Do newspapers accurately report collective action incidents? Are newspaper biases comparable to biases in official data? Can reporting bias be solved by increasing the number of newspapers used to collect data?
* Do newspaper target audiences impact collective action incident reporting? Does newspaper targeting lead to differences in tone, content, or the collective action events reported?
* When can newspapers be used to study public discourse?
* Can media source be attributed based on the language of media reporting? Are biases perceived in different language media irrespective of content?


## Collective Action and Terrorism
* Is Muslim radicalization a byproduct of low socioeconomic status or identity threat?
* Are elected and unelected officials differentially responsive to terrorist attacks?
* Do ethnic party bans increase terrorist attacks and riots?


## Competitive Authoritarianism

* When are valence issues important to voters in competitive authoritarian regimes?

## Regional Autonomy

* What impact does tourism, particularly small regional airport infrastructure, have on regional government demands for decentralization?
* How does the public talk about autonomous regions compared to de facto states?

## Dissertation: Ethnic Political Representation
* Why does ethnic representation only sometimes succeed in improving outgroup attitudes? While many international organizations encourage country leaders to implement ethnic representation, we know little about what determines whether ethnic representation succeeds in reducing ethnic tensions. In order for ethnic representation to meaningfully impact citizens, it first must improve outgroup attitudes among elites. I argue that elite ethnic diversity worsens outgroup attitudes, but that elite interethnic contact moderates this effect. Using experimental evidence from Indian local government officials, I provide the first test of the contact hypothesis among political elites. Understanding how ethnic representation impacts political elites is critically important since elites may react differently to contact due to their need to be politically calculating and astute. Interethnic contact in this setting may be critical for improving government stability.

* What impact do ethnically diverse political appointments have on governance? I de- sign the first study to test the effect of ethnic diversity on decision-making outcomes impacting citizens. Focusing on cabinet appointments, I argue that increasing ethnic cabinet diversity makes ethnicity more salient and worsens outgroup attitudes, leading to a reduction in government benefits provided to ethnically non-dominant citizens. I test this theory using state cabinet data and non-dominant ethnic group social welfare spending from India, where an exogenous shock to cabinet size provides an instrument for cabinet diversity. Difference-in-differences results show that increasing cabinet diversity has a positive e↵ect on social welfare spending, the opposite of the hypothesizes relationship. I suggest that moderator variables, potentially interethnic contact, counter the negative effect of ethnic diversity on non-dominant group social welfare spending.

* Can country leaders improve ethnic outgroup attitudes by making ethnic political appointments? Years of pressure from the international community calling for leaders to ethnically diversify their governments --- particularly cabinets --- seems to suggest that ethnic representation is key to improving citizen outgroup attitudes. I argue that citizens evaluate ethnic political representation based on their perceived benefit and attribute these changes in benefit to the outgroup. This means that as ethnic represen- tation increases, non-dominant citizens will attribute their increased benefit from said representation to the dominant ethnic group and improve outgroup attitudes. Out- group attitudes become more negative for dominant group citizens under the same conditions. To test these hypotheses, I conduct a vignette experiment with Albanians and Macedonians in North Macedonia where I randomize three forms of representation citizens care about: descriptive and substantive representation and ministerial cooperation. The results suggest that ethnic representation is not a clear solution to improving outgroup attitudes. Macedonians more frequently develop negative outgroup attitudes resulting from increased ethnic representation than Albanians improve said attitudes. Country leaders may need to address citizen wariness of politicians and their associated promises before ethnic cabinet representation can be effectively used to improve outgroup attitudes.

* How does valuing different types of ethnic representation motivate individuals to participate in collective action aimed at increasing said representation? Existing literature focuses on how citizens vote in favor of ethnic representation, but voting occurs infrequently and does not always align with citizen demands. I argue that valuing either descriptive or substantive representation will increase citizens’ willingness to participate in collective action and that substantive representation will be a particularly strong motivator. In repeated collective action events, the cost of participation de- creases, so there will be no distinction between citizens who value descriptive versus substantive representation. I also hypothesize that these effects may be more pronounced for non-dominant ethnic groups. Drawing on an original survey about community meting participation in North Macedonia, I find that ethnic Macedonians act as expected, whereas ethnic minority Albanians who value descriptive representation are more likely to participate in collective action. I confirm the non-dominant ethnic group findings using survey data on protest participation among New Zealand Maori. Country leaders cannot view collective action regarding representation as exclusively a call for substantive representation. These results show that non-dominant ethnic groups may be more motivated to engage in collective action descriptive rather than substantive representation.

* Ethnic Diversity in Central Government Cabinets (Published in _Politics, Groups, and Identities_): Why is there so much variation in the ethnic composition of cabinets? Previous work has focused on cabinet policy alignment, largely overlooking the role of identity-based characteristics like ethnicity. I theorize that country leaders make ethnic cabinet appointments to gain political support, both when country-level ethnic diversity is high and when ethnic groups rely on leader decisions in order to receive resources. Cabi- net appointments offer leaders a way to distribute resources while creating a credible commitment to remove these resources if ethnic group support wanes. I introduce a new cross-national time-series dataset of cabinet minister names from 149 countries from 1967 to 2017. Using novel methods from computer science, I code the ethnicity of cabinet ministers’ names and construct a cabinet diversity index for each country- year. After validating this measure, I find support for my hypothesis. Country leaders in reliant societies increase ethnic cabinet appointments seven to twenty-five percent over leaders in non-reliant societies. The results provide the first large scale cross- national analysis of the strategic ways in which leaders use cabinet seats to manage the distribution of resources.

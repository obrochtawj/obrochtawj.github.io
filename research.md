## Dissertation: Ethnic Political Representation
* Why does ethnic representation only sometimes succeed in improving outgroup attitudes? I argue that elite ethnic diversity worsens outgroup attitudes, but that elite interethnic contact moderates this effect. Using experimental evidence from Indian local government officials, I provide the first test of the contact hypothesis among political elites. Understanding how ethnic representation impacts political elites is critically important since elites may react differently to contact due to their need to be politically calculating and astute. Interethnic contact in this setting may be critical for improving government stability.

* Can country leaders improve ethnic outgroup attitudes by making ethnic political appointments? Years of pressure from the international community calling for leaders to ethnically diversify their governments --- particularly cabinets --- seems to suggest that ethnic representation is key to improving citizen outgroup attitudes. I argue that citizens evaluate ethnic political representation based on their perceived benefit and attribute these changes in benefit to the outgroup. I conduct a vignette experiment with Albanians and Macedonians in North Macedonia where I randomize three forms of representation citizens care about: descriptive and substantive representation and ministerial cooperation. The results suggest that ethnic representation is not a clear solution to improving outgroup attitudes. Country leaders may need to address citizen wariness of politicians and their associated promises before ethnic cabinet representation can be effectively used to improve outgroup attitudes.

* What impact do ethnically diverse political appointments have on governance? Focusing on cabinet appointments, I argue that increasing ethnic cabinet diversity makes ethnicity more salient and worsens outgroup attitudes, leading to a reduction in government benefits provided to ethnically non-dominant citizens. I test this theory using state cabinet data and non-dominant ethnic group social welfare spending from India, where an exogenous shock to cabinet size provides an instrument for cabinet diversity. Difference-in-differences results show that increasing cabinet diversity has a positive eâ†µect on social welfare spending, the opposite of the hypothesizes relationship. I suggest that moderator variables, potentially interethnic contact, counter the negative effect of ethnic diversity on non-dominant group social welfare spending.

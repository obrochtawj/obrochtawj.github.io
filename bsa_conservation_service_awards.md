Please note that the William T. Hornaday Awards have been discontinued and are being replaced by the BSA Distinguished Conservation Service Award. No information is available about the new award requirements; this page will be updated when relevant information is released.

I serve as the Council Distinguished Conservation Service Awards Coordinator for the Blue Ridge Mountains Council Conservation Committee. I earned my Hornaday Badge, Hornaday Silver Medal, and Hornaday Gold Badge and am an Eagle Scout.

This page provides Hornaday related resources that we use in the Blue Ridge Mountains Council. Our Hornaday Guide was the first comprehensive Hornaday documentation available when it was released in 2011. Now in its seventh edition, the BRMC Hornaday Guide is the most widely used source for Hornaday information in the country.

Please contact me at [william@obrochta.net](mailto:william@obrochta.net) if you are interested in learning more about the Hornaday awards or if you would like to start working toward earning an award. I have helped Scouts and Scouters from hundreds of Councils through this process. If you are not sure if someone in your Council advises Hornaday awards, contact me; I am happy to assist you and to help you find the resources you need.

## Hornaday Guide
[Click here to download the latest edition of the BRMC Hornaday Guide.](/hornaday/BRMCHornadayGuide.pdf) This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you as you work on a Hornaday award.

The Blue Ridge Mountains Council is pleased to provide some examples of Hornaday project workbooks. Note that these workbooks are from many stages of the Hornaday process and do not necessarily represent workbooks that accompanied submitted Hornaday award applications. Project type, age of the Scout, and scope varied significantly across these projects.

## Training and Other Documents
There is no formal training required to advise Hornaday projects or to be a Conservation Advisor. If you would like help with training for you or your Council, contact me and we will work with you to identify your needs and develop the best materials for your group.

We have extensive experience setting up Council Conservation Committees, Council Hornaday Committees, and programs to locate and train Conservation Advisors. Apart from the chapter in the Hornaday Guide dedicated to these topics, we have produced an information sheet for training Conservation Advisors that can also be used to train new Conservation Committee Members. [Click here to download the Conservation Advisor training.](/hornaday/BRMCConservationAdvisorInfo.pdf) We are also experienced in delivering Hornaday training to individuals or groups, if this is of interest.

We have a [basic information guide](/hornaday/HornadayBasicInformationGuide.pdf) and a ["how to" article](/hornaday/HornadayArticle.pdf) that may be helpful in training and promotion. We also have numerous slide presentations, handouts, and flowcharts that we can customize to the needs of your audience for presentations; contact me if you are interested.

Finally, we produced a series of videos on the Hornaday awards: [a narrated slide presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVvbEFv9HuQ), [a video on Dr. Hornaday's legacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-fh4ie7VJk), and [an overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgibKcPu50c).

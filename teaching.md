## Teaching Philosophy
I believe that students bring valuable perspectives and interests to political science that they can use to engage with research and to further develop interests and skills that will be broadly applicable. My chief goal in the classroom is to help students find how they can contribute to political science research in ways that are relevant to real world problems and important to their own values and career goals.

My research investigates core aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion. As such, I strive to create a collective engaged citizen identity among students in my courses, empowering students to relate political science to their own lives and to issues they care about, and setting up appropriate support structures for each student.

## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
My goal as a teacher is to help students see how political science can help them solve problems in their community â€” what I call "engaged citizens."" As such, my scholarship of teaching and learning research focuses on how students work through the political science research process and engage with the community. I view these two topics as the most important skills that political science teaches. The research process helps students to learn reading, writing, and critical thinking skills that are especially important for careers in law, government, and at non- profit organizations. Students then apply these skills through community engagement in order to demonstrate their power and relevance. I also work on developing, implementing, and assessing pedagogy professional development opportunities. This work has led to peer-reviewed publications in outlets like <i>Journal of Political Science Education</i> and <i>PS: Political Science and Politics</i>.

## Teaching Philosophy
I believe that students bring valuable perspectives and interests to political science that they can use to engage with research and to further develop interests and skills that will be broadly applicable. My chief goal in the classroom is to help students find how they can contribute to political science research relevant to real world problems and important to their own values and career goals.

## Teaching Experience and Interests
I value reflection as a way to process experiences and take feedback into consideration in order to improve my teaching. [Click here to download my reflections on these teaching experiences.](/files/OBrochtaTeachingReflections.pdf)

* **Introduction to Comparative Politics (Instructor):** [Download syllabus.](/files/IntroComparative.pdf) Designed course around student involvement in the research process. Incorporated research methods, reflective and formative journal writing, and policy application components into the syllabus. Students engage with published research and focus on writing their own research article through collaborative methods workshops.
* **Immigration, Identity, and the Internet (Assistant in Instruction):** [Download syllabus.](/files/ImmigrationIdentityInternet.pdf) Instructor for half of the classes. Re-designed the syllabus and re-structed assessments. Focused the course on improving writing skills and community engagement opportunities.
* **Political Protest and Violence (Assistant in Instruction):** Instructor for one-third of the classes. Developed formative and summative assessments, created interactive and experiential learning activities for classes when I was not teaching.
* **Theories of Social Justice (Assistant in Instruction):** Implemented comprehensive advising system to improve student assessment peformance. Mentored individual students on research papers.

#### Interests
* Research Design and Methods: [Download syllabus.](/files/ResearchMethods.pdf)
* Identity and Action
* Introduction to Formal Theory
* The Politics of Developing Nations
* Meta-Analysis for Social Scientists



## Pedegogy Training
* **Teaching Citation (expected 2021):** Documented and reflected on three substantial teaching experiences.
* **Graduate, Course Design Institute:** Intensive program with instruction on course design best-practices.
* **Student, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Course:** Semester-long interdisciplinary program to learn about SoTL research and begin designing a teaching research project.
* **Member, Graduate Teaching and Learning Community:** Participate in monthly meetings on a variety of teaching related topics.
* **Attendee, APSA Teaching and Learning Conference (2018, 2019)**

## Teaching Related Service
* **Washington University Teaching and Professional Development Committee (2018-):** Assess and make recommendations to improve graduate student teaching related training across the University.
* **Washington University Teaching Center Graduate Student Advisory Council (2017-):** Provide feedback on graduate student teaching programming, host events discussing pedegogy.


## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
My current research focuses on how well first year students in introductory political science courses can demonstrate research article writing skills. I am assessing this research question via a pre- and post-test design, a quantitative evaluation of rubrics for student work throughout the semester, and a post-semester focus group. I hope that this research can provide recommendations for ways to integrate writing into introductory courses of any size. I am also interested in group collaboration, active learning, and interdisciplinary teaching.

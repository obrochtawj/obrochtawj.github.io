## Teaching Philosophy
I believe that students bring valuable perspectives and interests to political science that they can use to engage with research and to further develop interests and skills that will be broadly applicable. My chief goal in the classroom is to help students find how they can contribute to political science research relevant to real world problems and important to their own values and career goals.

My research investigates core aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion. As such, I strive to create a collective political scientist identity among students in my courses, empowering students to relate political science to their own lives and to issues they care about, and setting up appropriate support structures for each student.

## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
My SoTL research focuses on making political science applicable and relevant to a broad and diverse group of students. This focus relates to my overall goal of training ``applied political scientists." I achieve this goal by guiding students through the research article writing process and involving them in community engaged activities.

Students often finish political science courses without feeling like they are a political scientist. They may be introduced to various topics in the discipline, but students are often just observers to the work that political scientists do. I argue that  students of any grade level, major, or experience can benefit from becoming what I call applied political scientists: individuals who know disciplinary skills, collaborate with one another, and apply their skills to relevant public policy problems. Becoming an applied political scientist teaches students how to use skills from the discipline to address everyday problems and questions. In other words, the discipline of political science is a way for students to learn important writing, critical thinking, collaboration, and career-related skills.

### Working Through the Political Science Research Process
Guiding students through the political science research process is one of my signature pedagogies. The research process involves exposure to all of the key aspects of political science: from developing research questions, to evaluating research design options, to presenting and providing feedback on work. The exact ways in which students engage with the research process vary depending on the type of course I am teaching. In upper-level seminar courses, I ask students to complete a full research article. This is more difficult in some larger introductory courses, so I emphasize exposing students to each part of the process. Students can work in small groups or through in-class activities to be conversant in each component of research without having to write a full research article on their own. The broad exposure to each facet of political science and the collaboration and connection to public policy that this exposure brings is my main goal.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, I conducted research in my Introduction to Comparative Politics course where students had almost no prior exposure to the research article process. My motivation for choosing this course was two-fold: first, if the process is an empowering force, then the best place to start is in introductory courses in order to get students excited about and invested in political science. Second, by teaching these concepts to mostly inexperienced non-majors and assessing their ability to perform article writing related tasks, I can set-up a pipeline where article writing is taught across different courses and expectations build on each other.

Using a pre- and post-test design coupled with a quantitative evaluation of student writing performance, I found that students in an introductory course can successfully navigate the research article writing process and do so quite proficiently. Further, student interest in political science, identification as a social scientist, and willingness to work hard to understand political science concepts significantly increased. My goal moving forward is to establish a series of courses where the research article writing process is taught in order to better prepare students for senior capstone experiences, to improve the quality of student writing, and to provide continuity between courses that encourages and supports students to become political science majors.


### Small-Scale Community Engagement
One of the most important parts of teaching students to be applied political scientists is emphasizing the relevance of doing political science research to public policy problems. Along with working through the research article writing process, my students develop policy briefing papers about their research findings and engage in legislative policy simulations that reveal how research can be applied to make improvements to policy. Since I teach comparative politics, many of the relevant, public policy connections we make seem to apply only to countries about which students may be interested, but where they have little personal investment.

To address this issue, I conceptualize and assess how community engagement can be employed in comparative politics courses. Community engagement is critically important for teaching students about diversity and inclusion, for establishing meaningful relationships with public policy practitioners, and for applying student research to generate meaningful community service.  In contrast to the limited existing work on comparative community engagement that emphasizes study abroad trips and extended volunteer placements, I investigate the effectiveness of small community engagement projects at increasing the public policy relevance of comparative politics theories. Small scale community engagement projects are much easier to integrate into existing courses and allow me to design courses that include both research article writing and meaningful community experiences.

I designed three types of small scale community engagement experiences ordered in terms of student investment and implementation complexity that I implemented in my Representation, Identity, and Dissent course. For each type, I used pre- and post-test surveys and reflections to assess both students' improved ability to relate comparative politics theories the course and to public policy topics and their understanding of people with different backgrounds and experiences. First, students worked alone on three small assignments where they learned about their community. These assignments included developing a community identity profile describing different identity-based groups in their area, attending a community meeting, and identifying public policy problems in the community and organizations working to address these problems. Next, students formed groups and went into the community and conducted qualitative interviews and compiled data on a public policy problem related to the research articles they were writing. Students relied on these data as evidence during an in-class legislative policy-making simulation. Finally, students participated in a whole class project to develop a training designed to help local youth working for a community partner identify issues of identity-based discrimination that they were experiencing and develop strategies for making their voice heard.

I found that each of these types of community engaged projects had major benefits for students' ability to relate course content to their lives, to understand how political science relates to public policy, and to better understand people from diverse backgrounds. In the future, I would like to expand this intervention to assess other potential outcomes that small-scale community engagement projects impact.

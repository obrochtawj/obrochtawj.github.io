# William O'Brochta
## Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research seeks to understand how ethnicity, particularly ethnic representation, shapes interactions between citizens and elites and when these interactions turn violent. I particularly focus on developing nations using a mix of experimental techniques and qualitative field work. I enjoy teaching and empowering students to connect comparative politics to their own lives through substantive courses on representation and identity as well as introductory courses and research methods. I have a B.A. from Hendrix College and an A.M. from Washington University in St. Louis.

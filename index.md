# William O'Brochta
## Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I invite students in my classes to become what I call "applied political scientists" where they learn transferrable critical thinking, research, and writing skills; collaboration and teamwork; and community engagement. My research seeks to understand how identity and representation shape relationships between political elites and the public and when these interactions turn violent. I use a mix of survey, experimental, observational, and qualitative techniques to study these questions, particularly in developing nations. I have a B.A. from Hendrix College and a M.A. from Washington University in St. Louis.

I serve as the Council William T. Hornaday Awards Coordinator for the Blue Ridge Mountains Council Conservation Committee. I am also the Council Life to Eagle Specialist. I earned my Hornaday Badge, Hornaday Silver Medal, and Hornaday Gold Badge and am an Eagle Scout.

This page provides Hornaday related resources that we use in the Blue Ridge Mountains Council. Our Hornaday Guide was the first comprehensive Hornaday documentation available when it was released in 2011. Now in its seventh edition, the BRMC Hornaday Guide is the most widely used source for Hornaday information in the country.

Please contact me at [mailto](mailto:william@obrochta.net) if you are interested in learning more about the Hornaday awards or if you would like to start working toward earning an award. I have helped Scouts and Scouters from hundreds of Councils through this process. If you are not sure if someone in your Council advises Hornaday awards, contact me; I am happy to assist you and to help you find the resources you need.
